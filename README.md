# Cube
This project is aimed to design and implement a Business rules framework on event streams, for operational alerts etc

There is a continuous stream of user activity events generated from multiple users as they use our mobile app. Objective is to implement a server to ingest these events. The server will expose a http end-point to which the events would be posted. Also the server will contain an admin interface to specify business rules, that alert the operator or trigger an action (like sending an alert sms to the end user), when certain criteria is met.
